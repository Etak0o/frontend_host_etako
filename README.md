## Nichole Naa Etako Baddoo's frontend READ.me file

## i chose to answer question 3, which was the Campus Food Ordering System

# Project Name
the name of my system is AcityEats
this is the link to the frontend GitHub pages : https://etak0o.github.io/frontend_host_etako/

# Description
1. I decided to make mine a simple one page system
2. the user can sign up entering their name, email, phone number, room number and password
3. the user can also log in using their email and password
4. the page also displays, types of foods into categories; breakfast, lunch, snacks and drinks
5. the user can add these items into their cart and view their order history and status

   ## PS
   sometimes, you'd have to refresh after you make an action, say you want to add an item to cart,
    and it does not display under orders, when you refresh it does display :(
